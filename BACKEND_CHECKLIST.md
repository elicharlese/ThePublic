# Backend Development Checklist for ThePublic


This checklist is designed to guide the backend development of ThePublic, ensuring robust integration with the React/Next.js frontend, blockchain (Solana), Supabase, and Vercel deployment. It covers all major features and logic required for a production-ready, scalable, and secure application. All documentation should be placed in the `backend/docs/` directory and kept up to date.

---


## 1. Project Setup & Environment
- [x] **Monorepo/Repo Structure**: Organize backend (Rust, TypeScript) and frontend (Next.js) codebases clearly.
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Define and document all required env vars (e.g., Solana RPC, Supabase keys, JWT secrets).
- [x] **Secrets Management**: Use Vercel/Supabase secrets for production; never commit secrets to git.
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for linting, testing, build, and deployment to Vercel.
- [x] **Production Build**: Ensure reproducible, optimized builds for both backend and frontend.
- [x] **Docs Directory**: Create and maintain `backend/docs/` for all backend documentation.
- [x] **Doc Optimization**: Regularly review and optimize documentation for clarity, completeness, and developer onboarding.

---

## 2. Blockchain (Solana) Integration (Rust)
- [x] **Node Registration**: Smart contract for node onboarding, unique identity, and Sybil resistance.
- [x] **Proof of Coverage**: Implement consensus logic for verifying node location and uptime.
- [x] **Reward Distribution**: On-chain logic for calculating and distributing rewards (coverage, traffic, reliability, contributions).
- [x] **Micropayment Channels**: State channel logic for efficient, low-fee user payments to node operators.
- [x] **Node/Wallet Management**: Secure wallet integration for node operators (hardware wallet support).
- [x] **API for Frontend**: Expose REST/gRPC endpoints for frontend to query node status, rewards, transactions, etc.
- [x] **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all smart contract logic.
- [x] **Documentation**: Document all on-chain programs and APIs.

---

## 3. Supabase (Database & Auth)
- [x] **User Authentication**: Email, OAuth, and wallet-based login (Solana signature verification).
- [x] **User Profiles**: Store and manage user/node operator profiles.
- [x] **Node Metadata**: Store node hardware, location, status, and performance metrics.
- [x] **Rewards History**: Track and expose reward payouts and transaction history.
- [x] **Blog/Content Management**: CRUD endpoints for blog posts, guides, and community content.
- [x] **Role-Based Access**: Admin, node operator, and user roles with appropriate permissions.
- [x] **API Rate Limiting & Security**: Protect endpoints from abuse.
- [x] **Realtime Updates**: Use Supabase subscriptions for live node/network status.

---

## 4. API Layer (TypeScript/Node.js)
- [x] **REST/gRPC Endpoints**: For all frontend needs (node status, performance, transactions, blog, etc.).
- [x] **Node Performance Metrics**: Expose bandwidth, uptime, user count, etc. (for dashboard, map, analytics).
- [x] **Network Map Data**: Serve real-time node locations, status, and connections for visualization.
- [x] **Wallet Operations**: SOL transfers, transaction status, and explorer links.
- [x] **Notifications**: Push/email notifications for rewards, maintenance, and network events.
- [x] **Validation & Error Handling**: Robust input validation and error reporting.
- [x] **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all endpoints.

---

## 5. Frontend Integration
- [x] **API Consumption**: Ensure all frontend components (dashboard, wallet, network map, node status, etc.) are connected to backend APIs.
- [x] **State Management**: Sync frontend state with backend (Supabase, blockchain, API).
- [x] **Wallet Connect**: Integrate Solana wallet adapters and handle transaction flows.
- [x] **Localization**: Support multi-language content from backend (EN, ZH, etc.).
- [x] **Error & Loading States**: Handle all backend errors and loading states gracefully in UI.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance
- [x] **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure all endpoints and on-chain actions.
- [x] **Data Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user input.
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of public APIs.
- [x] **Logging & Monitoring**: Set up error logging, performance monitoring, and alerting.
- [x] **GDPR/Privacy**: Ensure user data privacy and compliance.

---

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] **Unit Tests**: For all backend logic (Rust, TypeScript).
- [x] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests for API, blockchain, and database flows.
- [x] **Load Testing**: Simulate network and API load for scalability.
- [x] **Manual QA**: Test all user flows from frontend to backend.

---

## 8. Deployment & Operations
- [x] **Vercel Deployment**: Automated, production-ready deployment for frontend and serverless backend.
- [x] **Supabase Project**: Production instance with backups and monitoring.
- [x] **Solana Program Deployment**: Deploy smart contracts to mainnet/testnet as needed.
- [x] **GitHub Release**: Tag and release production builds.
- [x] **Rollback Strategy**: Plan for safe rollback in case of deployment issues.

---

## 9. Documentation
- [x] **Architecture Overview**: Diagrams and docs for backend architecture.
- [x] **API Reference**: Up-to-date docs for all endpoints and smart contracts.
- [x] **Runbooks**: Guides for deployment, monitoring, and incident response.
- [x] **Developer Onboarding**: Steps for new contributors to get started.

---

## 10. Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
- [ ] **Edge Caching & Content Delivery**
- [ ] **AI-Powered Network Optimization**
- [ ] **IoT Device Support**
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**
- [ ] **Multi-Protocol & Multi-Chain Support**
